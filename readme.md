# Cloud File Manager

## Setup

    npm install
    gulp default
    live-server

and navigate to http://localhost:8080/demo/

## Deploy

    gulp deploy

This will clean and re-build the `dist/` folder, and push the result to gh-pages.

The examples directory will be available at [http://concord-consortium.github.io/cloud-file-manager/examples/](http://concord-consortium.github.io/cloud-file-manager/examples/).

https://gist.github.com/sfentress/5ec336cc5a3f123d67dd  <- what setup options could look like

Should be able to run

* In iframe with menu bar
* In iframe without menu bar
* Without iframe, as a library?
